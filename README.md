# Bootdev CLI

The official command line tool for [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev). It allows you to submit lessons and do other such nonsense.

⭐ Hit the repo with a star if you're enjoying Boot.dev ⭐

## Installation

### 1. Install Go 1.22 or later

The Boot.dev CLI requires a Golang installation, and only works on Linux and Mac. If you're on Windows, you'll need to use WSL. Make sure you install go in your Linux/WSL terminal, not your Windows terminal/UI. There are two options:

**Option 1**: [The webi installer](https://webinstall.dev/golang/) is the simplest way for most people. Just run this in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sS https://webi.sh/golang | sh
```

_Read the output of the command and follow any instructions._

**Option 2**: Use the [official installation instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Run `go version` on your command line to make sure the installation worked. If it did, _move on to step 2_.

**Optional troubleshooting:**

- If you already had Go installed with webi, you should be able to run the same webi command to update it.
- If you already had a version of Go installed a different way, you can use `which go` to find out where it is installed, and remove the old version manually.
- If you're getting a "command not found" error after installation, it's most likely because the directory containing the `go` program isn't in your [`PATH`](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux). You need to add the directory to your `PATH` by modifying your shell's configuration file. First, you need to know _where_ the `go` command was installed. It might be in:

- `~/.local/opt/go/bin` (webi)
- `/usr/local/go/bin` (official installation)
- Somewhere else?

You can ensure it exists by attempting to run `go` using its full filepath. For example, if you think it's in `~/.local/opt/go/bin`, you can run `~/.local/opt/go/bin/go version`. If that works, then you just need to add `~/.local/opt/go/bin` to your `PATH` and reload your shell:

```bash
# For Linux/WSL
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/opt/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
# next, reload your shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
# For Mac OS
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/opt/go/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
# next, reload your shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 2. Install the Boot.dev CLI

This command will download, build, and install the `bootdev` command into your Go toolchain's `bin` directory. Go ahead and run it:

```bash
go install github.com/bootdotdev/bootdev@latest
```

Run `bootdev --version` on your command line to make sure the installation worked. If it did, _move on to step 3_.

**Optional troubleshooting:**

If you are getting the below error upon running the `go install github.com/bootdotdev/bootdev@latest` command: 

```
# Example of Module Error
go install github.com/bootdotdev/bootdev@latest
go: modules disabled by GO111MODULE=off; see 'go help modules'
```
Please enable modules and re-run the install command:
```
# Enable Modules
export GO111MODULE=on
```

If you're getting a "command not found" error for `bootdev help`, it's most likely because the directory containing the `bootdev` program isn't in your [`PATH`](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux). You need to add the directory to your `PATH` by modifying your shell's configuration file. You probably need to add `$HOME/go/bin` (the default `GOBIN` directory where `go` installs programs) to your `PATH`:

```bash
# For Linux/WSL
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
# next, reload your shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
# For Mac OS
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
# next, reload your shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 3. Login to the CLI

Run `bootdev login` to authenticate with your Boot.dev account. After authenticating, you're ready to go!

## Configuration

The Boot.dev CLI offers a couple of configuration options that are stored in a config file (default is `~/.bootdev.yaml`).

All commands have `-h`/`--help` flags if you want to see available options on the command line.

### Base URL for HTTP tests

For lessons with HTTP tests, you can configure the CLI with a base URL that overrides any lesson's default. A common use case for that is when you want to run your server on a port other than the one specified in the lesson.

- To set the base URL run:

```bash
bootdev config base_url <url>
```

*Make sure you include the protocol scheme (`http://`) in the URL.*

- To get the current base URL (the default is an empty string), run:

```bash
bootdev config base_url
```

- To reset the base URL and revert to using the lessons' defaults, run:

```bash
bootdev config base_url --reset
```

### CLI colors

The CLI text output is rendered with extra colors: green (e.g., success messages), red (e.g., error messages), and gray (e.g., secondary text).

- To customize these colors, run:

```bash
bootdev config colors --red <value> --green <value> --gray <value>
```

*You can use an [ANSI color code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit) or a hex string as the `<value>`.*

- To get the current colors, run:

```bash
bootdev config colors
```

- To reset the colors to their default values, run:

```bash
bootdev config colors --reset
```
